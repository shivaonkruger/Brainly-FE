# Workspace & Context Review

## 1. Context Analysis ([context.md](file:///c:/Users/anita/OneDrive/Desktop/brainly-fe/context.md))
The [context.md](file:///c:/Users/anita/OneDrive/Desktop/brainly-fe/context.md) file provides a clear and well-structured vision for a **"Second Brain" application**.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Explicitly defines Antigravity's role (UI/Frontend) vs. the manual Backend.
*   **Defined Core Features**: Lists concrete screens (Auth, Dashboard, Feed) and data entry points.
*   **Philosophy**: "Thinking-first design" is a strong guiding principle for the UI.

## 2. Workspace State (`brainly-fe`)
The current workspace is a **fresh Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** project.
*   **Tech Stack**: Aligns perfectly with a modern frontend workflow.
    *   `react` ^19.2.0
    *   `tailwindcss` ^4.0.0
    *   `vite` ^6.0.0
*   **Current Progress**:
    *   The `src` directory is effectively empty (default Vite template).
    *   **Missing**: No components, routing, API layer, or pages exist yet.

## 3. Discrepancies & Recommendations
There is no "discrepancy" per se, but rather a **complete lack of implementation** of the outlined context.

### Recommended Next Steps
1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Create the directory structure to support the described architecture.
    *   `src/components` (UI elements)
    *   `src/pages` (Auth, Dashboard, Feed)
    *   `src/services` (API connection to Backend)
    *   `src/context` (Auth state)
2.  **Dependencies**: Install `react-router-dom` to handle the navigation between Auth and Dashboard.
3.  **UI Foundation**: Setup the "Antigravity/v0" workflow to generate the basic layouts for the **Authentication** screens (Signup/Signin) as the first milestone.
